# 🪞 Reflection — AI Prescription Agent

## 🧠 Project Overview
The **AI Prescription Agent** project was developed to automate the process of reading and interpreting handwritten medical prescriptions. It leverages **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **AI-driven automation** to convert prescriptions into structured digital data that can be logged, analyzed, and shared efficiently.

The project also integrates with **Google Sheets** for secure data storage and **Telegram** for instant prescription summaries and notifications.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- To **automate the extraction** of data from handwritten prescriptions using AI.  
- To **reduce manual errors** in interpreting doctor’s handwriting.  
- To **simplify the prescription management workflow** for clinics and pharmacies.  
- To **integrate OCR + NLP + Telegram** to create a seamless AI-powered system.

---

## 🧩 Key Contributions
- Designed a modular **AI system** with OCR reading, text parsing, and logging.  
- Integrated **Google Sheets API** for live prescription data management.  
- Developed a **Telegram Bot** for real-time communication of prescription details.  
- Created a **recommender system** for suggesting medicine alternatives.  
- Implemented **AI parser logic** for classifying medicine names, dosages, and durations.
